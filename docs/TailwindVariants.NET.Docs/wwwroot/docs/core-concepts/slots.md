# Slots

**Slots** are a core feature of **TailwindVariants.NET** that allow you to define reusable, named “buckets” of classes for your components. They give you fine-grained control over styling specific parts of a component, without hardcoding CSS strings.

Think of a slot as a **strongly-typed placeholder** in a component that you can populate with different styles.

## Why Slots?

When building components, you often need to style different parts separately:

```csharp
<button class="px-4 py-2 rounded bg-blue-500 text-white">
    <span class="font-semibold">Click me</span>
</button>
````

Here, the outer `<button>` and the inner `<span>` require different styles. Using slots, you can define these parts declaratively, and apply variants safely:

* ✅ Strongly typed — no more guessing class names.
* ✅ Flexible — style each part of a component independently.
* ✅ Integrates with variants — combine slots and variants for full customization.
* ✅ Compile-time helpers — thanks to source generators.

## Defining Slots

A slot is defined as a nested class inside a component that implements `ISlots`:

```csharp
public sealed partial class Button : ISlotted<Button.Slots>
{
    public sealed partial class Slots : ISlots
    {
        public string? Base { get; set; }
        public string? Label { get; set; }
    }
}
```

Here, `Base` represents the main container of the button, and `Label` represents the text inside it.

## Using Slots

You map your slots with `TvDescriptor` and optionally use variants:

```csharp
public static readonly TvDescriptor<Button, Slots> _button = new(
    @base: "",
    variants: new()
    {
        [b => b.Variant] = new Variant<Variants, Slots>()
        {
            [Variants.Primary] = new() 
            { 
                [s => s.Base] = "bg-blue-500 text-white", 
                [s => s.Label] = "font-semibold" 
            },
            [Variants.Secondary] = new() 
            { 
                [s => s.Base] = "bg-gray-200 text-black", 
                [s => s.Label] = "font-medium" 
            }
        }
    }
);
```

Then in your component:

```razor
<button class="@_slots.GetBase()">
    <span class="@_slots.GetLabel()">Click me</span>
</button>
```

The `GetBase()` and `GetLabel()` methods are generated by the source generator, ensuring type safety and discoverability.

## Best Practices

* Use **descriptive slot names** — e.g., `Base`, `Icon`, `Label`.
* Combine slots with **variants** for maximum flexibility.
* Avoid hardcoding classes in the markup — always use `_slots.Get{SlotName}()`.
* Define all slots inside the component class — it keeps them strongly typed and self-contained.

Slots, together with variants, allow **TailwindVariants.NET** to provide a fully type-safe and maintainable approach to styling Blazor components.
